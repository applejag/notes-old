# Song of the siren

The song of the siren is an old tale. The sirens are these sea creates that looks
like the most beautiful women that the observers (men at sea) could even imagine.

They sing their songs, luring the men closer and closer to the edge of their
ships, and eventually having them slip into the water where the sirens then
devour them alive like sharks.

## Moral of the story

You see something that is so beautiful that you just sprint towards it, but once
you embrace it you are devoured by it.

Sample applications of this is [[overdoing-volatility-decomposition]]#.

# Regulations are written in blood

Certificates for a job is not developed and enforced out of thin air *just
because we can*; certificates used to regulate are created as a political
construct when something needs regulating.

This insight, the need of certificates/regulations, first pops into peoples heads
first when something has gone terribly wrong, or was very close to the edge of
a catastrophy.

Therefore, the saying holds up terribly well:

> Regulations are written in blood.

# Designing a house against the requirements

Requirements are not to be ignored, but they are also not the main focus.

Imagine we build a house, and listen to the requirements of the family that will
buy this brand new home.

## Identifying the requirements

Let's consider a family who wants a new home. They want a house.

This family is so heavily focused on cooking. They want a house they can do some
proper cooking in. They want the best equipment. The best kitchen tables. The
best ovens. The most feature-complete set of pots, pans, and knives.

Cooking is the number 1 priority.

This house is for family that loves cooking. Got it.

## Start implementing

You design the house with all intent that cooking is the requirement. It is the
best house for cooking. THE best.

## Requirements change

Family just moved in. They're tired. They order a pizza.

The house ~~explodes~~ fails.

## What was the real requirement?

It was not cooking. It never is cooking.

The requirements of a house is to take care of its inhabitants.

Everything else is fluff. Details.

If you design the house using #[[functional-decomposition]], then you're never
done with the specifications. They will never fulfil the requirements.

## Key takeaways

- Do not **ignore** the requirements
- Do not **design against** the requirements

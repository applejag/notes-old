# Electrician vs Electrical engineer

A person can be neither, either, or both. All depending on what they are
currently working on, but more importantly: How they approach it.

This applies to other engineering works as well, such as the difference between
a *software developer* and a *software engineer*.

## Electrician

An electrician commonly has the knowledge to:

- Build electric components
- Repair them
- Disassemble
- Reassemble
- Use existing parts to construct new ones

An electrician commonly works with electricity, such as helping you out at home
as you should [[[never-change-a-plugs-amperage]]] yourself.

## Electric engineer

An electrical engineer commonly has the knowledge to:

- Design new equipment
- Plan electrical projects
- Invent new electronics by using the existing frameworks

## They overlap

As you might realize, these two "roles" overlap quite a bit. They have their
distinct sets of features, but you can easily picture yourself the same person
switching between being an electrician and being an electrical engineer.

Both roles:

- Solve problems, from complex to mundane.
- Develop solutions, ready to ship products.

It is the knowledge and procedures that differ an electrician from an electrical
engineer. Though even that line is fuzzy.

# Advanced words from Elantris

This page is created is true subjective spirit. These are words I stumbled upon
while reading Elantris by Sanderson, B.[^elantris], that I've either seen used
here and there but never looked up their definition, or words that are totally
new to me. Dislike me all you want for not knowing some of these words if you
consider them "basic AF", but you should know better than to punch downwards ;)

I began this practice of writing these down since page 44.
Current highest page is 58. <!-- UPDATE THIS WHEN ADDING NEW WORDS -->

<!-- Sort the rows alphanumerically after each addition/alteration -->

[^elantris]: Sanderson, B. (2016). *Elantris* (Revised definitive tenth anniversary edition). Dragonsteel Entertainment, LLC 2005.
[^why-swedish]: My native tongue is Swedish, and so it helps me remarkably well to force myself to define them in two languages as it leads me to much better understand their meanings.
[^page]: The "Page" column refers to the page where I first *found* the word. It does not strictly mean that is the words first appearance, nor that the word only appears on said page.

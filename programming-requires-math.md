# Programming requires maths

A common question that arises from newcomes to the software development field
is:

*"Do I have to be good at math to become a programmer?"*

The answer most commonly given is the spontaneous one: *"No."*

But the thing is: yes, you need to be good at maths; but not the type of math
you maybe were expecting.

## Misconception about maths

If you're comparing a software engineer with a mechanical engineer, at first
glance it does look like the mechanical engineer does much more "math" than the
software engineer. But this is because the mechanical engineer does much more of
the types of math that you're used to, back from your math studies in school.

Math is not *just* the algebra or trigonometry. Calculating numbers, or figuring
out angles and weight in complex formulas on a peice of paper.

A mechanical engineer, to continue on that rail, commonly deals with "continous
math":

- **Calculus**: Integrals, limits, complex numbers
- **Trigonometry**: Angles, triangles, shapes
- **Differential equations**: Derivitaves

A software engineer commonly tampers in the "discrete math" regions:

- **Graph theory**: Sorting, heap, storing data efficiently
- **Logic**: Algorithms, arguments, deductive reasoning
- **Combinatronics**: Factorials, permutations, combinations

Both types of engineers cover math. Just not "typical math" that one might think
of. Also, one does not exclude the other; there are plenty of sub-fields within
both software and mechanical engineering that covers wider or even completely
other fields of math than what the stereotype suggests.

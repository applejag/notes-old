# Linux memory layout

Your RAM in Linux is built upon the following abstractions:

- Each CPU (multi-core or not) is associated to their own [[[fea696a7]]], ex: Node 0.

  - Each node is made up of [[[4e7771c9]]], ex: DMA, DMA32, Normal.

    - Each zone contains a set number of [[[1feba3fd]]], usually at the size of 4096
      bytes.

      - Each page can have a [[[fbeba87e]]], ex: anonymous, file-backed,
        device-backed.
    
The Linux kernel can alter how file-backed and anonymous mapped pages are stored
by moving them back and forth between RAM and disk. This is referred to as
"swapping". Read [[[4b91deb2]]]

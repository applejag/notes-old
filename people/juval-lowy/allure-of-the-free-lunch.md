# Allure of the free lunch

This is a common phrase told by #[[juval-lowy]]. In other words: *"There is no such
thing as a free lunch"*, or *"You cannot add value without sweating"* 
(J. Löwy, January 27, 2021).

> "Nothing worse than responding 'We will fix it. No sweat!'"

## Alchemists

Alchemism is an old profession to turn dirt into gold. This has never been proven
by anyone, and yet there was enourmous amount of resources put into the subject
by any lord and country to hire alchemists to turn dirt into gold.

It can be suggested that it is in our nature to find the "silver bullet" that
will make us rich without working.

Doing #[[functional-decomposition]] is equivalent to the olden alchemists, and
is therefore why it will be increadibly difficult (if not impossible) to
convince your teammates that functional decomposition is bad.

## The most famous alchemist of them all

Isaac Newton spent years of his life searching for the philosophers stone, just
because of the allure of the free lunch.

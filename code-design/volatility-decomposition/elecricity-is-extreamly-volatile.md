# Electricity is extreamly volatile

Implementing electricity as a feature to your system and considering the
volatilities of it by desigining by #[[volatility-decomposition]], then you'll
quickly notice that electricity is extreamly volatile.

## Volatilities of electricity

These are things that can change, and probably will change. You as a designer
need to account for these.

You'll have to pick your fights. What range of options do you want to support
per volatility?

- Power source

  - Wind mill
  - Generator
  - Solar panel

- Voltage

  - $230V$ (as per european customs)
  - $120V$ (as per american customs)

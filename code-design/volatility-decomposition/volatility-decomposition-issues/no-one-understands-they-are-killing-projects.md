# No one understands they are killing projects

Features are to be implemented. At least, that's the spirit of when designing
by #[[functional-decomposition]]. But persuing functional decomposition
essentially kills the project before the first programmer even sets their
fingers to work.

But this is not jolly news. Software has been designed (and is being designed)
this way. Telling all those senior architects and managers that what they
actually have been doing is dooming their projects is borderline impossible
because they surely do not want to hear these news.

## Pre-bacteria doctors

Before bacteria was discovered, doctors would not wash their hands. Bacteria
spread is actually highly lethal to an open wound on a person who's trying to
recover from some serious damage.

There was one doctor that noticed a correlation of washing hands and patients
surviving. With enough assertions, this doctor concluded that there is something
that we transfer with our hands that kills their patients.

This doctor spread the news and tried to convince other doctors that they are
killing their patients from this lack of washing hands, with the argument that
it's almost malicious in the way they operate.

No doctor understood. They refused the fact. This became considered madness.

This doctor who made the discovery was stripped from being titled a doctor, and
banned from ever practicing medicine.

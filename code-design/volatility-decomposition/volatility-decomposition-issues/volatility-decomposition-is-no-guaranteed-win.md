# Volatility decomposition is no guaranteed win

Designing software with #[[volatility-decomposition]] does give you the
opportunity to succeed with your software, but it does not mean an automatic
success just because you try it.

## Uphill battle

Fighting #[[functional-decomposition]] in favor of #[[volatility-decomposition]]
gives you a *fighting chance*. It will be tough, and it will require you to toil
with learning and practicing; but it makes it possible.

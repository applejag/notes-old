# Issues with repeating design misstakes

Designing by #[[volatility-decomposition]] is supreriour to
desigining by #[[functional-decomposition]]. And yet, we fall into this trap
again and again.

## Einsteins famous quote

If you're tasked with creating the architecture for a reboot of a project that
died because it was too difficult to maintain, integrate, and develop further,
then choosing to do the reboot the same way is essentially killing the project
before it's even started.
